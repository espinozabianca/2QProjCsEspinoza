    <article class="about">
      <p>This website aims to raise awareness on the situation of STEM in the Philippines through the use of articles that summarize content from various verified sources.</p>
      <p>siSTEMa wishes to highlight that the problems the STEM industry is facing right now is not something we can address individually but rather <i>systemically.</i> As you explore the website, you'll find: </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Organizations in the Philippines that can provide you with more in-depth information on specific STEM issues such as gender inequality in the tech industry or climate action</li>

        <li>Short but adequate information on STEM education in the Philippines and why it matters</li>
      </ul>

      <p>It is recommended that you read the articles from <b>left to right</b> based on how they are presented in the home page. (importance first, then challenges, and improving STEM education last).</p>

      <p>After you explore every nook and cranny of siSTEMa, I hope it not only empowers you to push for change in STEM education but also allows you to appreciate STEM as a subject. </p>

      <h1>How to improve <br>STEM education</h1>
      <p>We start by changing the way view STEM.</p>

    <article>
      <p>To improve STEM education, we must first understand the importance of it. We need to bridge the gap of science communication between researchers and the masses, and the best way to do that is to show that science is not just textbooks and journals; it’s everywhere. It's in the ice cream you eat, it's why airplanes can carry dozens of people along with their luggage, it can explain why floods are happening in your area.</p>

      <p>We cannot improve STEM education without realizing that science is always for the people. We need to stop the practice of gatekeeping knowledge through complex words or professional jargon.</p>

      <p>Some youth organizations have started to create content that is breaks down complex STEM topics to make it easily understandable for people. An example is the MathTuto video series of the youth organization <a href="https://www.facebook.com/scicreateyouth/">SciCreate</a> in collaboration with Philippine Science High School - Main Campus (PSHS-MC) students that teaches high school math topics in Filipino.</p>

      <p>The government must also provide economic incentives for Filipino scientists and teachers to stay.</p>

      <p>In 2018, the Balik Scientist program was signed into law. This provides incentives for Filipinos in STEM to take local employment opportunities and share their skills with the country. Some of these incentives include monthly allowance, medical insurance, free round trip airfare, and grants-in-aid research.</p>

      <p class="imageCaption">Balik Scientist act provides incentives like monthly allowance and medical insurance for Filipino scientists provided they stay in the country.</p>

      <p>Nonetheless, jobs in the STEM field are still severely underpaid, with research scientists earning only P38,419 monthly on average. A doctor working in Philippine General Hospital (PGH) earns P20,000 a month. This year, the average cost of living in Manila is P50,798.</p>

      <p>Having a Balik Scientist program in place is not enough. We have to change the way we treat STEM as a whole.</p>

      <p><i>"Aanhin ninyo ba 'yung research?... Gusto ba ng farmer ang research? Hindi ba gusto nila tulungan niyo sila?"</i> - Senator Cynthia Villar, Chairperson of the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Food</p>

      <p>(What will you do with it [research]?... Does the farmer want research? Don't they want you to help them?)</p>
        
      <p>Actually, a lot of the things that are currently helping farmers, such as irrigation systems and tractors, wouldn't have been possible without proper scientific research.</p>

      <p>Other policies, such as the Bayanihan Law or the health protocols released by the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF), should be well-researched and always needs to be agreed upon by not just economists, but doctors and scientists as well.</p>

      <p>So, <i>aanhin nga ba ang research?</i> Well-funded research can improve all aspects of this country, from natural disaster response to fish kills or bird flu outbreaks. That's just the tip of the iceberg of what we can fix if we just prioritize STEM over the military.</p>
      
      <p>STEM, especially research and development, is essential to economic development and the government must be able recognize that. Economics and science are not completely independent entities; in fact, they are almost always co-dependent.</p>

      <p>If the people in power themselves fail to see that, how can we ensure high-quality and accessible STEM education for the masses?</p>

      <p><b>We can't.</b> At least, not on our own. We have to start small; we need more people to see and appreciate the importance of STEM, and we can do this by raising awareness on some social issues and how STEM can help explain or solve them. The improvement of STEM education is a huge advocacy to push for, but it's not impossible.</p>
        
      <p>The government has to prioritize STEM education; this has been long overdue, but even more so now that we're in the middle of a pandemic.</p>

      <h1>Challenges of <br>STEM education</h1>
      <p>Why are so many of our country's <br>STEM graduates leaving?</p>
    </header>

    <article>
      <p>In the Philippines, science is reserved for the few who have the capability to invest in quality education; but even then, students and teachers still face challenges like outdated textbooks and lack of laboratory facilities and equipment.</p>

      <p>According to the Department of Education's (DepEd) data in 2014, Regions III, IV-A, X, XI, and XII only have one school with a science laboratory out of every ten public elementary schools. In the National Capital Region (NCR), this ratio is 3 laboratories for every ten elementary schools. Public elementary schools in other regions don’t have any science laboratory at all.</P>

      <p>The country is also suffering from a lack of qualified STEM teachers in both rural and urban areas. This is because most STEM graduates leave the country in pursuit of a better income and overall quality of life. But that's already the best case for many STEM graduates; some developed countries don't even recognize some bachelor’s degrees from a Philippine university, which means you have to tolerate not only being underpaid but also harsh work conditions.</p>

      <p>According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the recommended ratio of researchers and scientists within a given country to its population (called researchers per million) is 380/million. As of 2013, the Philippines only has <b>189 researchers/million.</b> In comparison, Malaysia has 2,100/million, South Korea has 6,900/million, Thailand has 974/million, and Vietnam clocks in at 674/million—all of which are above the suggested baseline.</p>
        
      <p>The STEM industry is heavily underfunded, and its budget is continuously reduced. A report from the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) shows that the Philippines has consistently allocated a gross expenditure for R&D (GERD) of only <b>0.14%</b> of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP). UNESCO’s baseline is one percent.</p>
        
      <p>In 2020, DOST suffered a Research and Development (R&D) budget cut of more than ₱76 million for 2021, resulting to only ₱2.411 billion allocated to the program. Overall, DOST received only a ₱23.8 billion budget instead of its proposed ₱36.2 billion.</p>

      <p><i>"Ang dami nating pinagtatapos na PhD at Masters na naghahanap ng research work, wala namang bagong [plantilla] item sa DOST, SUCs (state universities and colleges) para sa ganyang linya,"</i> DOST Secretary Fortunato Dela Peña said. <i>"Sa private sector, kaunti ang investors ng R&D."</i></p>

      <p>(A lot of students are finishing with PhD and Masters degrees and are looking for research work, but there are no new plantilla items for them under the DOST, SUCs for that line. In the private sector, very few investors support R&D.)</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the proposed Philippine National Police (PNP) budget for 2021 amounted to ₱190.846 billion, with PNP chief, General Camilo Cascolan, himself admitting that 89% of that is allocated on  personnel services for the salary and allowances of 228,000 PNP personnel.</p>

      <p>Given all these, it's no surprise that there has been an undersupply of around 600,000 graduating STEM students amidst the pandemic; and it’s likely to be even higher if we don’t change the way we teach—and view—STEM as a subject.

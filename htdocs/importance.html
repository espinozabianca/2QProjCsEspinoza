      <h1>Why is STEM <br>important?</h1>
      <p>STEM education is a long-term investment that can effectively address a lot <br> of the economic and even political issues in the Philippines</p>
    </header>

    <article>
      <p>STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) challenges people to think critically and formulate innovative solutions through its labwork, experiments, and problem sets. </p>
      <p>Thus, STEM can ultimately help us overcome multiple global and local challenges such as:
      <ul>
        <li>Natural disasters, environmental degradation and climate change</li>
        <li>Lack of accessible healthcare for the masses</li>
        <li>Lack of self-sustainable agricultural practices</li>
        <li>Persistent poverty and increasing inequality</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>Especially amidst the pandemic, people are turning to more industries related to STEM—be this pharmaceuticals, medicine, and even technology. With more people tapping into these industries—thus creating more job opportunities in the field—it becomes even more crucial for a country to have a competitive yet accessible STEM education.</p>

      <p>Having a structured STEM curriculum in the Philippines will also make us globally competitive in ever-growing fields. In developed countries like the US, STEM occupations are growing at 24% while others are only growing at 4%.</p>
  
      <p>In fact, employment in STEM jobs is projected to grow 8.8% by 2028, and the healthcare industry (which is primarily STEM) is bound to grow even more.</p>

      <p>According to Alexander Koty in Asean Briefing (2021), there's an increasing demand in STEM, particularly in the medical field: "In early 2021, Germany requested the deployment of 15,000 medical workers from the Philippines, while a 2020 study suggested that the UK will likely require over 50,000 additional nurses over the next four years."</p>

      <p>Even if students may not take STEM-related jobs in the future, the collaborative, inquisitive, and analytical skills they acquire from comprehensive STEM education is still invaluable and will definitely benefit them in the future. STEM gives you mindset that repeatedly asks and looks for the answers, which is something advantageous even outside of work.</p>

      <p>Having effective STEM education not only increases appreciation for the field but also brings us closer to improving the lives of the masses. It is crucial then to address the challenges STEM education currently faces in the Philippines.</p>
